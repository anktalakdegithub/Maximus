            <h5>What is Money Laundering?</h5>
            <p>
                Money Laundering can be defined as engaging in financial transactions that
                involve income derived from criminal activity, transactions designed to
                conceal the true origin of criminally derived proceeds and appears to have
                been received through legitimate sources/origins
            </p>
            <p> In simple terms money laundering is most often described as the “turning of
                dirty or black money into clean or white money”. If undertaken successfully,
                money laundering allows criminals to legitimize "dirty" money by mingling it
                with "clean" money, ultimately providing a legitimate cover for the source of
                their income. </p>
            <p>Section 3 of the PMLA Act defines money laundering in following words:</p>
            <p>“Whosoever directly or indirectly attempts to indulge or knowingly assists or knowingly is a
                party or is actually involved in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime
                and projecting it as untainted property shall be guilty of offence of money-laundering”.</p>
            <h5>Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002</h5>
            <p>Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA 2002) forms the core of

                from July 1, 2005.</p>

            </ul>
            <h6>Be careful while accepting Clients of Special category:</h6>
            <p>We should be careful while accepting clients of special category like NRIs, HNIs, Trust,
                Charities, NGOs, Politically Exposed Persons (PEP), persons of foreign origin,
                companies having closed shareholding/ownership, companies dealing in
                foreign currency, shell companies, overseas entities, clients in high risk
                countries, non-face to face clients, clients with dubious background.
                Current/Former Head of State, Current/Former senior high-profile
                politician, Companies offering foreign exchange, etc.) or clients from highrisk countries (like Libya,
                Pakistan, Afghanistan, etc.) or clients belonging to
                countries where corruption/fraud level is high (like Nigeria, Burma, etc).
                Scrutinize minutely the records / documents pertaining to clients belonging
                to aforesaid category.</p>
            <p>
                Senior management approval would be obtained for establishing business
                relationships with PEPs. Where a client has been accepted and the client or
                beneficial owner is subsequently found to be, or subsequently becomes a
                PEP, MSL shall obtain approval from Director to continue the business
                relationship.
            </p>
            <h6>Guidelines on Identification of Beneficial Ownership:</h6>
            <p>For nonindividual customers as part of the due diligence measures sufficient
                information must be obtained in order to identify persons who beneficially
                own or control securities account. Whenever it is apparent that the
                securities acquired or maintained through an account are beneficially
                owned by a party other than the client, that party should be identified and
                verified using client identification and verification procedures as early as
                possible. The beneficial owner is the natural person or persons who
                ultimately own, control, or influence a client and/or person on whose behalf
                a transaction(s) is/are being conducted. It includes persons who exercise
                ultimate effective control over a legal person or arrangement.</p>
            <h6>Do not accept client registration forms which are suspected to be
                fictitious:</h6>
            <p> Ensure that no account is being opened in a fictitious / benami
                name or on an anonymous basis.</p>
            <h6>Do not compromise on submission of mandatory information/
                documents: </h6>
            <p>Client’s account should be opened only on receipt of mandatory
                information along with authentic supporting documents as per the
                regulatory guidelines. Do not open the accounts where the client refuses to
                provide information/documents and we should have sufficient reason to
                reject the client towards this reluctance. </p>
            <h6>5. CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURE (FOR NEW CLIENTS) </h6>
            <p>Objective: To have a mechanism in place to establish identity of the client
                along with firm proof of address to prevent opening of any account which is
                fictitious / benami / anonymous in nature.</p>
            <p>Documents which can be relied upon:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>PAN Card: PAN card is mandatory and is most reliable document as
                    only one card is issued to an individual and we can independently
                    check its genuineness through IT website.</li>
                <li>IDENTITY Proof: PAN Card itself can serve as proof of identity.
                    However, in case
                    PAN card carries an old photograph of the holder, which does not
                    match current facial features of the client, we should take other
                    identity proof in form of Voter’s Identity card, Passport, Ration Card
                    or any Government/PSU/Bank issued photo identity card.</li>

                    customer’s source of funds. </li>
                <li>Scrutinize the forms submitted by the client thoroughly and cross check
                    the details with various documents obtained like source of income. If required, ask for any
                    additional details like salary slips, etc. to satisfy
                    yourself whenever there is a doubt. </li>
                <li>For scrutiny / background check of the clients, websites such as
                    www.watchoutinvestors.com should be referred. Also, Prosecution

                    client with such employee should be documented. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>7. FOR ALL EXISTING CLIENTS </p>
            <p>On an on-going basis, the branches should ensure that the details given in
                the KYC, by the client, matches with the current details of the client. If
                required, we can seek additional documents/information from the client to
                verify the financial/general status of the client.
                In cases where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is any material negative change in the financial details of the
                    client from what is given in the KYC. </li>

                <li>The client refuses to provide additional information/document asked for. </li>
                <li>There is a material change in the mandate holder profile/details </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Branches/operations team should immediately bring the same to the notice
                of the Business Head. The Business Head will, in turn, discuss the same
                with the Principal Officer to decide on the necessary course of action,
                including reporting to FIU, New Delhi.</p>
            <p>8.Risk Profiling Of The Client</p>
            <p>We should accept the clients based on the risk they are likely to pose. The
                aim is to identify clients who are likely to pose a higher than average risk of
                money laundering or terrorist financing. For this purpose, we need to
                classify the clients as Low risk, medium risk and high-risk clients. By
                classifying the clients, we will be in a better position to apply appropriate customer due diligence
                process. That is, for high risk client we have to apply
                higher degree of due diligence. The factors of risk perception depend on
                client’s location, nature of business activity, turnover, nature of transaction,
                manner of payment etc. </p>
            <p>In order to achieve this objective, all clients should be classified in the
                following category :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Category A – Low Risk </li>
                <li>Category B – Medium Risk</li>
                <li>Category C – High risk</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Category A clients are those pose low or nil risk. They are good
                corporate/HNIs who have a respectable social and financial standing. These
                are the clients who make payment on time and take delivery of shares.
            </p>
            <p>Category B clients are those who are intra-day clients or speculative clients.
                These are the clients who maintain running account with MSL. </p>
            <p>Category C clients are those who have defaulted in the past, have suspicious
                background, do not have any financial status, etc. </p>
            <p>We have to be careful while monitoring the transactions of B and C category
                clients. Apart from this we need to exercise extra caution while monitoring
                the transactions of NRI/NRE/PIO and foreign clients, especially when the
                payment is being made in foreign currency.</p>
            <h6>9. MANDATE HOLDER POLICY </h6>
            <p>The primary objective of this policy is to ensure that we are aware as to who
                is the ultimate beneficiary of the transaction and that the transactions
                executed, through the mandate holder are bonafide. </p>
            <p>It is possible that some of the individual clients might appoint a mandate
                holder. Normally the trading account is opened in the name of various
                family members and one the family member will hold the mandate. Also, in
                case of some NRI clients who are based abroad, there may be on a
                PoA/Mandate in favour of a person residing in India </p>
            <p>Whenever any account is operated by a mandate holder, find out the
                relationship of the mandate holder with the client, followed by establishing
                the identity of the mandate holders by obtaining proof of identity and
                address. </p>
            <p>Do not accept any payment from the account of mandate holder in favour of
                the client. All the payments have to be received from the client’s bank
                account only for which the PoA holder may or may not have the mandate to
                operate the bank account. Similarly, pay-out cheques should be issued only
                in the name of the client and not in the name of the mandate holder.
            </p>
            <p>In case there is suspicion on the relationship between the mandate holder
                and the actual client or in case behaviour of the mandate holder is
                suspicious, do take necessary advice from the Business Head.</p>
            <h6>10. ROLES </h6>
            <p>Relationship Manager/ Dealer/ Branch Manager/ Branch Coordinator/
                Business Head</p>
            <p>The RM/ Dealer/ BM/ Coordinator should meet the client in person at least
                once before opening the account at the address given by the client. In the
                process he may reasonably verify the living standards, source of income,
                financial status, etc. of the client and ensure that the details mentioned in
                the CRF (Client Registration Form) matches with the actual status. </p>
            <p>If the client is a ‘walk-in client’, then the concerned branch official should
                make independent verification about the background, identity and financial
                worthiness of the client. </p>
            <p>All mandatory proofs of identity, address and financial status of the client
                must be collected as prescribed by the regulatory authorities, from time to
                time. The proofs so collected should be verified with the originals. If the
                prospective client is refusing to provide any information do not forward his/
                her account opening form to HO.</p>
            <p>IN PERSON VERIFICATION can do by SUB BROKER for SUB BROKER
                Clients. </p>
            <p>The Business Head has to be completely satisfied about the background,
                genuineness and financial status of the client before recommending for
                opening the account. If required, the Business Head may seek additional
                information/documents from the client. </p>
            <p>If the account is to be handled by a PoA /mandate holder, then find out
                what is the relationship between the client and the PoA/Mandate holder,
                establish the identity and background of the client and the PoA/Mandate
                holder (by obtaining the required documents) and ensure that the
                PoA/Mandate Holder has the proper authorization. </p>
            <p>In case of a corporate account, the branch officials should ensure that the
                authorized person has got the required mandate by way of Board
                Resolution. Also, the identity and background of the authorized person has
                to be established by obtaining the required documents. </p>
            <p>Foreign clients can deal in Indian market only to sell the shares allotted
                through ESOP or buy/sell as a ‘foreign direct investment’. We cannot deal
                for foreign clients under any other circumstances.</p>
            <p>Please consult the Departmental Head before dealing with any NRE, NRO,
                PIO or foreign clients. </p>
            <h6>11. RISK MANAGEMENT TEAM</h6>
            <p>Risk Management Team (RMT) gives exposure to clients based on margin
                available in the system and clean exposure to selected clients based on
                recommendations of the Business Managers. It is also the duty of RMT to
                validate such exposures with the financial details provided by the client in
                KYC forms. Where there is a trading activity of the client, which is not
                commensurate with the financial details declared by the client, it should be
                analysed and referred to the Principal Officer with reasons of suspicion.</p>
            <h6>12. MONEY LAUNDERING & TERRORIST FINANCING RISK POLICY</h6>
            <p>Maximus Securities Ltd shall carry out risk assessment to identify, assess
                and take effective measures to mitigate its money laundering and terrorist

            <h6>13. MONITORING OF TRANSACTIONS</h6>
            <ul>
                <Li> Scrutinize unusually large transactions like, clients having traded in
                    scrip/shares of a company for a quantity of 20,000 or more in a single
                    day and volume in that scrip of that client is 25% or more of the total
                    volume in that scrip of the Exchange. </Li>
                <Li>Check trade log for indication of negotiated trades (if any)</Li>
                <Li>Check for any relation of the client with the company / directors /
                    promoters. </Li>
                <Li>Check previous trading pattern of the clients in that particular scrip. </Li>
                <Li>Scrutinize bulk deal transactions by sample check. A ‘bulk’ deal
                    constitutes transaction in a scrip (on each Exchange) where total
                    quantity of shares bought/sold is more than 0.5% of the number of
                    equity shares of the company listed on the Exchange </Li>
                <Li>Select randomly few clients and pick their few transactions and
                    scrutinize to check whether they are of suspicious nature or not.</Li>
                <Li>If substantial increase in turnover in a dormant account is found,
                    should be brought into the notice of the senior management. Review
                    balances and trading in the dormant accounts. Be vigilant on the
                    movement of credit balances of the dormant account. </Li>
                <Li>Analysis is carried out by RMT to identify clients with huge and regular
                    losses and are still placing trades/orders. Identify the Sources of funds
                    in such cases.</Li>

            <ul>
                <li>Analysis of top clients in terms of turnover:</li>
                <li>On a periodic basis identify top 200 clients on descending order of
                    turnover and ascertain whether the same matches with the financial
